## Game Idea
For our game, we will create a 2d side-scrolling platformer. 

## General Action Plan
For the development of the game, we are planning to have weekly meetings to discuss the progress of the development and report on what each team has contributed in the past week. For our first meeting, we established the game type and genre and came up with a general idea for the game requirements.
The start of each team member will create one use case describing the functionality of the system. In addition to this, each member will create the UML diagrams for the components of the system which we will edit and combine at our next team meeting. At our next team meeting, the goal is to finalize the UML diagrams and use cases as well as generate the mockups for the user interface.
